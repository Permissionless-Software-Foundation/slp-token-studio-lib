# slp-token-studio-lib

This JavaScript library controls the business logic for the [Token Studio web app](https://nft-creator.fullstack.cash/), which is used to create and manage NFTs on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. These NFTs are created using the [SLP token protocol](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md) and the [PS002 specification for mutable token data](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md).

This repository started as a fork of [npm-lib-boilerplate-esm](https://github.com/christroutner/npm-lib-boilerplate-esm).
